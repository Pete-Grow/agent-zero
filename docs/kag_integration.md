# KAG Integration

Agent Zero integrates KAG (Knowledge Augmented Generation) to provide enhanced logical reasoning and retrieval capabilities. KAG is a framework based on OpenSPG engine and LLMs that supports logical reasoning and factual Q&A for domain-specific knowledge bases.

## Features

- Knowledge and Chunk Mutual Indexing
- Concept-based semantic reasoning
- Schema-constrained knowledge construction
- Logical form-guided hybrid reasoning

## Usage

```python
# Initialize KAG tool
kag_tool = tools.get_tool('kag')
kag_tool.init_kag()

# Query using logical reasoning
response = kag_tool.query("What is the relationship between X and Y?")

# Update knowledge base
kag_tool.update_knowledge({
    "concept": "entity_name",
    "properties": {...}
})
```

## Configuration

KAG integration can be configured through the standard Agent Zero configuration system. Key settings include:

- Knowledge base location
- OpenSPG engine settings
- Reasoning parameters

Refer to the [KAG documentation](https://github.com/OpenSPG/KAG) for detailed configuration options.
